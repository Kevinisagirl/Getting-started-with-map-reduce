# Getting-started-with-map-reduce

The goal is to get a Map-Reduce library up and running on your machine and to do a few exercises to gain familiarity with the Map-Reduce paradigm.

Here is a helpful tutorial on MrJob. https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/guides/quickstart.html

The example text files can be used as input for the MapReduce programs. (punctuation has been removed)

1.Write a MapReduce program that counts the total number of words in a file.

2.Write a MapReduce program that counts the number of times "the" appears in the file.

3.Write a MapReduce program that counts the number of 3-letter words in a file.

4.Write a MapReduce program that counts the number of words that begin with each letter.(That is, how many words start with 'a'? How many words start with 'b'? ... )

5.Write a MapReduce program that for each possible word length computes the averagenumber of vowels in the word. (That is, words with 4 letters typically have how manyvowels? Words with 5 letters typically have how many vowels?)
